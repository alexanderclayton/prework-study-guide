## Description
This study guide was created during the KU Coding Bootcamp precourse work.  After a decade in the hospitality industry, I decided to pivot in my career and learn to code.  Building this study guide was a quick crash course in a topic I have no experience in.  While not all of the information covered in this exercise makes complete sense to me yet, it established a foundation from which I'll build my further understanding of this topic throughout the bootcamp.
